# HTML/CSS website 


This website was written based on a psd website layout file.

I used HTML and CSS to make this website. Website layout I took from the Internet. Several sections have been made on this website, and the buttons have also been animated when hovering over them. Also, if desired, it is possible to make the functionality of the buttons so that they transfer the user to other web pages.

This project was written for a portfolio.
